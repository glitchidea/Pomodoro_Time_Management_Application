# Pomodoro Time Management Application
  This Python code includes a console application aimed at time management using the Pomodoro technique. Users can engage in focused work (Pomodoro) for a specific duration, followed by a short break, and repeat this cycle for a certain number of sets. Additionally, users can add, complete, and delete tasks, as well as customize application     settings.
  
  Application Functionality:
  
  Pomodoro duration, set count, and break duration can be customized by the user.
  Users can add, complete, and delete tasks.
  The task list and elapsed time are displayed during work sessions.
  An audible alert is triggered when a Pomodoro is completed, and the break period begins.
  Users can customize Pomodoro duration, set count, break duration, and the alert sound through the settings menu.
  (This is also my initial submission.)
